### Code is magic.

I'm a Flutter Developer Jr and I create ideas and develop solutions in the shape of software using my creativity and my technical knowledge in Flutter/dart by building mobile apps.

I'm studying Flutter and Dart to become a better mobile developer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own projects.
- ðŸŒ± I have experience with Flutter and Dart by building some projects.

A clean and understandable code, as a good poem should be.
